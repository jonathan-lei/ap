### Scripts used for Advanced Placement

The AP Daily classroom provides some introductory content. But what if you don't want to leave it or want to reference it in the future? I've been working on a few scripts to enable you to hoard this data :) 

THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATION!!! DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE, DO NOT MONETIZE!!! 

1) scrape-wistia-ids.js:
Run this in your browser's console when you are logged into AP Classroom. It uses JavaScript to loop through each unit and each video to find the Wistia ID (outputting a comma separated string). You can then look at the Wistia ID to download the video for your own data hoarding needs.
